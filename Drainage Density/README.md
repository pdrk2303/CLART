## Drainage Density
Drainage network of the watershed helps in visualizing which areas have a high groundwater recharge. Drainage density is directly related to slope and inversely proportional to permeability. The steeper the slope with low permeability, the higher the drainage density, thus less infiltration and more surface runoff.
